## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Make sure you copied the **entire key** (starts with `gsk_`)
- No extra spaces before/after the key
- Key must be active (not deleted from Groq console)

### "Rate Limit" Error
- Free tier has limits (usually very generous)
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Or create a new API key

### Key Expired
- Groq keys don't expire automatically
- But you can revoke/delete them from console
- Just create a new one if needed

## 💡 Pro Tip

Create **2-3 API keys** and keep them as backups:
1. Primary key (use daily)
2. Backup key 1 (if primary hits limits)
3. Backup key 2 (emergency)

This way you always have a working key! 🎯
